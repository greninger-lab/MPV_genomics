# MPV_genomics
This repository contains the analysis described in the article "".

The NCBI accession numbers and associated metadata for the human metapneumovirus (hMPV) genomes can be found in the file Sample_metadata.xlsx.

Phylogenetic trees for hMPV groups A and B are provided in mpva_iqtree.treefile and mpvb_iqtree.treefile, respectively. Timetrees are available as mpva_timetree.tre and mpvb_timetree.tre.

To visualize the trees, you can use software such as FigTree. When importing the trees, be sure to also include the corresponding annotation files: A_treeannotation.txt for hMPV-A and B_treeannotation.txt for hMPV-B. These annotation files will enable you to display the trees with metadata.
