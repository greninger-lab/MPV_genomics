# MPV_genomics
This repository contains the analysis described in the article **"Recent Human Metapneumovirus Genomic Diversity within Expected Evolutionary Trends"**.

The NCBI accession numbers and associated metadata for the human metapneumovirus (hMPV) genomes can be found in the file Sample_metadata.xlsx.

Maximum-likelihood trees for hMPV groups A and B are provided in /IQtrees and timed Bayesian trees in /BEAST2.
To visualize the trees, you can use software such as FigTree.
